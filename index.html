				<h1>Corbett Inside Stay Tour</h1>
				<p>The Dhikala Zone is one of the most popular and picturesque zones in Jim Corbett National Park. Known for its diverse wildlife and dense forest cover, it offers visitors a chance to experience the natural beauty and rich biodiversity of the park. The Dhikala Tour is especially sought after for those looking to experience the park’s core area and stay overnight within its boundaries.The Dhikala Forest Rest House is one of the few places to stay inside the core area of Jim Corbett. It provides a unique experience as it is located deep within the forest, offering guests the chance to hear the sounds of the jungle at night and be closer to wildlife.</p>
			   <p><span>Permits and Regulations:</span> The Dhikala Zone requires special permits for entry, and the bookings for the rest house and safaris should be made in advance due to high demand and limited availability.</p>
			   <p><span>Best Time to Visit:</span> The Dhikala Zone is open from mid-November to mid-June. The rest of the year, it remains closed due to monsoons.</p>
			  <p><span>Facilities: </span>The Dhikala Rest House offers basic facilities, but don’t expect luxury. The emphasis is on experiencing nature rather than comfort.

				<h2>Dhikala Canter Safari :</h2>
				<p>Canter safari is conducted by the Corbett forest officials in the Dhikala zone to provide an opportunity to explore the rich wildlife of this zone. The Canter safari is the only option for the wildlife lovers who stay out of the Dhikala tourism zone and want to visit the area because the Day Jeep safari is not conducted for this zone. The Canter is a 16-seater open bus and a seat on the Canter can be booked from online or from the Corbett National Park office in Ramnagar. The starting point of the Canter safari is Ramnagar Corbett office so the tourists can board the Canter here for the safari if they have pre-booked permit. During the day safari, the Canter makes a stop at the Dhikala forest rest house for a while and tourists can get down from the Canter, get refreshed, take a walk around the compound and can also enjoy the beauty of the overlooking Ramganga river as well as the chance sighting of various wild animals on the riverbed.</p>

				<p>In order to visit the Bijrani zone, you have to obtain an entry permit for the safari, which you have to show to the forest officials at the entry gate. You can book your safari entry permit through online maximum of 45 days in advance or you can book the same day safari from the forest office in the Ramnagar after paying the required fee. Booking is done on the first come, first served basis and is a subject to availability. Along with the entry permit, you also have to hire a safari jeep and a guide/naturist, which are mandatory for the entry in the tiger reserve area. Maximum of six adults and two children (below 12 years) are allowed in one safari jeep apart from the driver and a guide. It is always best to book your permit in advance before reaching at the Corbett tiger reserve as there is always a rush of tourists for the safari and only 30 safari jeeps are allowed to enter into the Bijrani zone in one shift and almost all jeeps are pre-booked.</p>

				<h1>Geography of Jim Corbett National Park</h1>
				<p>Jim Corbett National Park, located in the state of Uttarakhand, India, is one of the most famous and oldest national parks in the country. Established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, it was later renamed in honor of the renowned hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett. The park covers an expansive area of about 1,318 square kilometers, including buffer zones and the core area, making it a significant ecological and geographical region in the country.
</p>				
				<h4>Terrain and Topography:-</h4>
                <p>The terrain of Jim Corbett National Park is incredibly diverse, featuring a mix of hills, grasslands, riverine belts, marshy depressions, and large lakes. The park is situated at the foothills of the Himalayas, and its altitude ranges from 400 meters to 1,220 meters above sea level. The undulating landscape creates a rich variety of habitats that support an equally diverse array of wildlife.
	</p>

				<h4>Rivers and Water Bodies:-</h4>
                 <p>One of the most significant features of the park’s geography is its extensive network of rivers and water bodies. The Ramganga River is the lifeline of the park, meandering through its heart and sustaining the rich flora and fauna. Several smaller streams, locally known as nalas, also traverse the park, contributing to the ecosystem’s vibrancy. Additionally, the park is dotted with numerous lakes and waterholes, which provide critical water sources for animals, especially during the dry season.

</p>
				<h4>Flora and Vegetation:</h4>
				<p>The geography of Jim Corbett National Park supports a wide range of vegetation types, from dense moist deciduous forests to open grasslands. The park is home to over 600 species of plants, including sal, khair, and sissoo trees that dominate the forested areas. The grasslands, known locally as chaurs, are crucial for herbivores like elephants and deer, while the riverine vegetation supports a rich diversity of aquatic plants.

</p>
                		<h4>Fauna and Biodiversity:</h4>
                 <p>The diverse geography of Jim Corbett National Park makes it a haven for a wide variety of wildlife.

Reptiles, including crocodiles and gharials, are also commonly found in the park’s rivers and lakes.

</p>
			
                 		<h4>Ecological Significance:</h4>
                  <p>Beyond its beauty and biodiversity, the geography of Jim Corbett National Park plays a critical role in the broader ecological landscape of the region. The park acts as a natural buffer for the surrounding human populations, helping to mitigate the impact of floods and soil erosion. Its forests are a crucial part of the Terai Arc Landscape, a region that supports some of the most significant populations of large mammals in Asia.

</p>             
       		     <h4>Conservation Efforts:</h4>
